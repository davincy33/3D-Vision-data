# 3D-Vision-data-compression
A method to extract stereo image and convert to 3D Video.

Now we will have the difference frames and the original recording from the cameras.
On superimposing the difference frames with the subtrahend frame from above, we get back the original recording.
Now, placing them side by side using ffmpeg commands and viewing in a VR box would result in a 3 dimensional video.

Use FFMPEG to merge the videos.
